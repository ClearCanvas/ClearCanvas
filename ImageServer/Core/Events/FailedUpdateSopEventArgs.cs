	/// EventArgs for when a SOP Instance has been modified/updated
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The following example code shows how to define an extension that will receive UpdateSopEventArgs events.
	/// Just create a class that implements <see cref="IEventHandler{TImageServerEventArgs}"/> and add
	/// the appropriate ExtensionOf attribute as shown below.  In this event case, it will be called each
	/// time a SOP Instance UID is modified or updated by the ImageServer.  This would happen after an
	/// instance is reconciled, edited, or replaced due to the use of a Duplicate SOP Policy.
	/// <code>
	/// [ExtensionOf(typeof(EventExtensionPoint{FailedUpdateSopEventArgs}))]
	/// public class UpdateSopEventArgsHandler : IEventHandler{FailedUpdateSopEventArgs} 
	/// {
	///    public void EventHandler(object sender, UpdateSopEventArgs e)
	///    {
	///    }
	/// }
	/// </code>
	/// </remarks>
	[ImageServerEvent]
	public class FailedUpdateSopEventArgs : SopEventArgs
	{
		public string FailureMessage { get; set; }
	}
