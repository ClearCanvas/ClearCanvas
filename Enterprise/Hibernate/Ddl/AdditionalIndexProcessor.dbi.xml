This file demonstrates the format of the dbi.xml files (it is not an embedded resource
since it is not actually used - it is for documentation purposes only).

Each line specifies a table and a set of columns to include in the index.  The index will
be created on the columns in the order in which they are specified (order is important
to the index performance).

The name of the index is not specified, because the indexes are named automatically
by the processor.  The name is generated by concatenating the column list and prepending
IX_.  For example, the first line would generate an index named IX_COLUMN11COLUMN12.
