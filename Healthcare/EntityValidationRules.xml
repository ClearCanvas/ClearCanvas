    WARNING: IF YOU ARE NOT SURE IF YOU SHOULD BE EDITING THIS DOCUMENT, YOU SHOULDN'T BE.
  
  
    USAGE NOTES:
    
    A ruleset must specify the entity class to which it applies, hence the class attribute is required.
    A ruleset may optionally specify an id, although this currently is not used by the application.
    The default version of this document defines two rulesets for a hypothetical entity named 
    ClearCanvas.Healthcare.Foo.  These rulesets will have no effect (unless you happen to define such an entity).
  
    Each rule-set may define any number of validation-rule entries, and may optionally define a single applicability-rule.
    For example, the first example ruleset (id = "default") defines 2 validation-rules, nameRequired and ageRequired.
    The second ruleset (id="active") defines 1 validation-rule, activationDateRequired, and an applicability-rule.
    The "default" ruleset will always be evaluated, because it does not define an applicability condition.
    The "active" ruleset will only be evaluated when the applicability condition is true (in this case,
    the instance of Foo has State == Active).
