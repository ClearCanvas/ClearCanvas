    Parameters: 1. the reference procedure type.
    Note: it may seem that the outer select is not necessary given that the inner select returns exactly what we want.
    However, removing the outer select causes NHibernate to issues 1+N selects in order to obtain the full ProcedureType
    entity for each result.  The addition of the outer select allows the entire query to execute as a single SQL statement.
