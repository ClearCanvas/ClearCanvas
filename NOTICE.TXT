License Note

This license is based on the open source zlib/libpng license. The idea was to
keep the license as simple as possible to encourage use of NUnit in free and
commercial applications and libraries, but to keep the source code together and
to give credit to the NUnit contributors for their efforts. While this license
allows shipping NUnit in source and binary form, if shipping a NUnit variant is
the sole purpose of your product, please let us know.
